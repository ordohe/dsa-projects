# Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains selected Java-based projects completed in the course *Data Structures and Algorithms (CS231)* at Colby College. Each project explores a core data structure or algorithmic concept through simulations, games, or analyses. Projects emphasize object-oriented programming, problem solving, and real-world applications.

## Projects

### 🂡 [Blackjack Simulation](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/blackjack_simulation)
Monte Carlo simulation of Blackjack using custom classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, etc.) and ArrayLists. Demonstrates basic OOP design.

### 🌱 [Conway’s Game of Life](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/conways_game_of_life)
A cellular automata simulation rendered using Java Swing. Emphasizes 2D arrays and graphical interfaces.

### 🧍 [Agent-Based Simulation](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/agent-based-simulation)
Simulates social behavior in a continuous 2D landscape using linked lists and agent update logic.

### 🧠 [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/sudoku_solver)
Implements a depth-first search algorithm using a custom stack to solve Sudoku puzzles.

### 📊 [Word Frequency (BST)](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/word_frequency_bst)
Analyzes word frequencies in a text using both binary search trees and hash maps to compare performance.

### 🕵️ [Pursuit-Evasion Game](https://github.com/ordohe/dsa-projects/tree/main/pursuit-evasion)
Graph-based turn-by-turn simulation between a pursuer and an evader. Involves custom graph, queue, and heap implementations.
