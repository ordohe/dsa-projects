# Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains selected Java-based projects completed in the course *Data Structures and Algorithms (CS231)* at Colby College. Each project explores a core data structure or algorithmic concept through simulations, games, or analyses. Projects emphasize object-oriented programming, problem solving, and real-world applications.

## Projects

### 🂡 `blackjack_simulation` – Monte Carlo Blackjack
Simulates hundreds of rounds of Blackjack to explore the statistical properties of the game. Focused on building Java classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Blackjack`) and applying object-oriented design.

### 🌱 `conways_game_of_life` – Cellular Automata Simulation
Implements Conway’s Game of Life using Java Swing to visualize a dynamic grid of cells that follow simple rules to simulate life, death, and rebirth. Involves 2D arrays and GUI programming.

### 🧍 `agent-based-simulation` – Grouping Behaviors Simulation
Models social behaviors using agents in continuous 2D space. Each agent interacts with others based on distance and type. Emphasizes linked list structures and simulation logic.

### 🧠 `sudoku_solver` – Stack-Based Puzzle Solver
Uses a depth-first search algorithm powered by a custom stack implementation to solve Sudoku puzzles. Explores backtracking and constraint satisfaction strategies.

### 📊 `word_frequency_bst` – Word Frequency Analysis
Compares the efficiency of binary search trees and hash maps for word counting tasks. Involves parsing text files and analyzing structure performance.

### 🕵️ `pursuit-evasion` – Graph-Based Strategy Game
Implements a turn-based pursuit-evasion game on a graph. Uses custom graph structures to simulate movement, pathfinding, and player strategy. Reinforces priority queues and abstract data types.

## Notes
- All projects are written in Java.
- Some folders may include compiled `.class` files for demonstration purposes.
- GUI-based projects utilize `Java Swing` for visualization.
